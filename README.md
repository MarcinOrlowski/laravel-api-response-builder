## Introduction ##

 `ResponseBuilder` is a [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) package, designed to help you build a nice, normalized and easy to consume
 REST API JSON responses.

## Benefits ##

 `ResponseBuilder` is written for REST API developers by REST API developer and is based on long-lasting experience on both
 "sides" of API. It's lightweight, with **no** dependencies, extensively tested and simple to use yet flexible and powerful,
 with support for [on-the-fly data conversion](docs/conversion.md), [localization support](docs/docs.md#messages-and-localization),
 automatic message building, [chained APIs](docs/docs.md#code-ranges) and (hopefully) [exhaustive documentation](docs/README.md).
 But that's not all! The JSON structure produced by `ResponseBuilder` is designed with **users of your API** in mind, so its
 structure is predictible and [well-defined](docs/docs.md#response-structure) which makes dealing with your API using
 `ResponseBuilder` library a breeze. Simple JSON response, with well-defined and predictable structure, easy to consume
 without any hassle or trickery. **Your** clients will love it. And will love **you** too :)

 You are also covered in a case of emergency, as provided [ExceptionHandlerhelper](docs/exceptions.md), ensures your API keeps
 talking JSON (and NOT lame HTML) to its clients even in case of unexpected.

 Did I mention, you would also get [testing traits](docs/testing.md) that automatically add PHPUnit based unit test to your
 whole `ResponseBuilder` related code and configuration with just a few lines of code **absolutely for free**?
