# Requirements #

Each major version of `ResponseBuilder` is tightly coupled with the PHP version required by its
target Laravel version. For example, `ResponseBuilder` v12 requires PHP 8.2+, because Laravel v12
requires PHP 8.2+. This is the case even if the library would technically work on older PHP
versions.
