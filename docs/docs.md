## Response structure ##

Predictability, simplicity and no special-case is the key of the `ResponseBuilder` design. I wanted to make my life easier not only when I develop the API itself, but also when I later consume its output while writing client (i.e. mobile) applications. So JSON response with this package is **always** of the same core structure and **all keys** are always present no matter of the values. Sample response:

    {
      "success": true,
      "code": 0,
      "locale": "en",
      "message": "OK",
      "data": null
    }

where 

  * `success` (**boolean**) tells response indicates API method failure or success,
  * `code` (**int**) your own return code (usually used when `success` indicates failure),
  * `locale` (**string**) locale used for returned text error message (obtained automatically via `\App::getLocale()`). This helps when your API is multilingual so clients can check returned data is in correct language version,
  * `message` (**string**) human readable message. Usually explains meaning of `code` value,
  * `data` (**object**|**null**) whatever additional data your API produces will be returned here. Even you return no extra data that key  still be here, however with `null` value.

**NOTE:** If you need to return other/different fields in **core** response structure (not in `data`), see [Manipulating Response Object](#manipulating-response-object) chapter for guidance of how to do that.

----

## Usage examples ##

The following assumes package is properly installed and enabled. These steps are described in details later, so keep reading.

#### Success ####

To report success from your API, just conclude your Controller method with:

    return ResponseBuilder::success();

which will produce and return the following JSON object:

    {
      "success": true,
      "code": 0,
      "locale": "en",
      "message": "OK",
      "data": null
    }

If you would like to return some data with your success response (which pretty much always the case :), wrap it into `array` and pass it to `success()` as argument:

    $data = [ "foo" => "bar" ];
    return ResponseBuilder::success($data);

which would return:

    {
      "success": true,
      "code": 0,
      "locale": "en",
      "message": "OK",
      "data": {
          "foo": "bar"
      }
    }

`ResponseBuilder` is able to do the object conversion on-the-fly. Classes like Eloquent's
Model or Collection are pre-configured, but you can easily make any other class handled. See
[Data Conversion](#data-conversion) chapter for more details.


**IMPORTANT:** `data` node is **always** a JSON Object. This is **enforced** by design, 
therefore if you need to  return an array, you cannot pass it directly:

    // this is WRONG
    $returned_array = [1,2,3];
    return ResponseBuilder::success($returned_array);

as this, due to array-to-object conversion, would produce:

    {
      ...
      "data": {
         "0": 1,
         "1": 2,
         "2": 3
      }
    }

which most likely is not what you expect. To avoid this you need to make your array part of 
the data object, which simply means wrapping it into another array:

    // this is RIGHT
    $returned_array = [1,2,3];
    $data = ['my_array' => $returned_array];
    return ResponseBuilder::success($data);

This would produce expected and much cleaner data structure:

    {
       ...
       "data": {
          "my_array": [1, 2, 3]
       }
    }

**WARNING:** do NOT wrap without giving the key:

    // this is WRONG
    $data = [[1,2,3]];
    return ResponseBuilder::success($data);

as what you get in result depends on what is the index of first element of `$data`, which can simply
be anything.

#### Errors ####

Returning errors is almost as simple as returning success, however you need to provide at least error
code to `error()` method which will be then reported back to caller 
(see [Installation and Configuration](#installation-and-configuration)). Indicating failure is
as easy as:

    return ResponseBuilder::error(ApiCode::SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG);

This will produce the following JSON response:

    {
       "success": false,
       "code": 250,
       "locale": "en",
       "message": "Error #250",
       "data": null
    }

Please note the `message` key in the above JSON. `ResponseBuilder` tries to automatically obtain error
message for each code you pass. This is all configured in `config/response_builder.php` file, with
use of `map` array. See [ResponseBuilder Configuration](#response-builder-configuration) for more details.
If there's no dedicated message configured for given error code, `message` value is provided with use 
of built-in generic fallback message "Error #xxx", as shown above.

As `ResponseBuilder` uses Laravel's `Lang` package for localisation, you can use the same features with
your messages as you use across the whole application, including message placeholders:

    return ResponseBuilder::error(ApiCodeBase::SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG, ['login' => $login]);
    
and if message assigned to `SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG` code uses `:login` placeholder, it will be 
correctly replaced with content of your `$login` variable.

You can, however this is not really recommended, override built-in error message mapping too as
`ResponseBuilder` comes with `errorWithMessage()` method, which expects string message as argument.
This means you can just pass any string you want and it will be returned as `message` element
in JSON response regardless the `code` value. Please note this method is pretty low-level and string
is used as is without any further processing. If you want to use `Lang`'s placeholders here, you need
to handle them yourself by calling `Lang::get()` manually first and pass the result:

    $msg = Lang::get('message.something_wrong', ['login' => $login]);
    return ResponseBuilder::errorWithMessage(ApiCodeBase::SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG, $msg);

----

## Return Codes ##

 All return codes are integers however the meaning of the code is fully up to you. The only exception
 is `0` (zero) which **ALWAYS** means **success** and you cannot use `0` with `error()` mehods (but
 you **can** have other codes for success than `0`).

#### Code Ranges ####

 In one of my projects we had multiple APIs chained together (so one API called another, remote API).
 I wanted to be able to chain API invocations in the way that in case of problems (and cascading
 failure) I still would able to tell which one failed first. For example our API client app calls
 method of publicly exposed API "A". That API "A" internally calls method of completely different
 and separate API "B". Under the hood API "B" delegates some work and talks to API "C". When something
 go wrong and "C"'s metod fail, client shall see "C"'s error code and error message, not the "A"'s.
 To acheive this each API you chain return unique error codes and the values are unique per whole chain
 To support that `ResponseBuilder` features code ranges, allowing you to configure `min_code` and 
 `max_code` you want to be allowed to use in given API. `ResponseBuilder` will ensure no values not
 from that range is ever returned, so to make the whole chain "clear", you only need to properly assign
 non-overlapping ranges to your APIs and `ResponseBuilder` do the rest. Any attempt to violate code range
 ends up with exception thrown.

 **IMPORTANT:** codes from `0` to `63` (inclusive) are reserved by `ResponseBuilder` and must not be used 
 directly nor assigned to your codes.

 **NOTE:** code ranges feature cannot be turned off, but if you do not need it or you just have one API
 or no chaining, then just set `max_code` in your configuration file to some very high value.

----

## Exposed Methods ##

 All `ResponseBuilder` methods are **static**, and for simplicity of use, it's recommended to
 add the following `use` to your code:

    use MarcinOrlowski\ResponseBuilder\ResponseBuilder;


 Methods' arguments:

 * `$api_code` (**int**) any integer value you want to be returned in `code`,
 * `$data` (**mixed**|**null**) any data you want to be returned in your response as `data` node,
 * `$http_code` (**int**) valid HTTP return code (see `HttpResponse` class for useful constants),
 * `$lang_args` (**array**) array of arguments passed to `Lang::get()` while building `message`,
 * `$message` (**string**) custom message to be returned as part of error response (avoid, use error code mapping feature).
 * `$encoding_options` (**int**) data-to-json conversion options as [described in documentation of json_encode()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php). Pass `null` for default `ResponseBuilder::DEFAULT_ENCODING_OPTIONS` ([source](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/laravel-api-response-builder/blob/master/src/ResponseBuilder.php#L47)). See [configuration](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/laravel-api-response-builder/blob/master/config/response_builder.php#L106) (see config's `encoding_options` too)

 Most arguments of `success()` and `error()` are optional, with exception for `$api_code`
 for the `error()` and related methods. Helper methods arguments are partially optional - see
 signatures below for details.

 **NOTE:** `$data` can be of any type you want (i.e. `string`) however, to enforce constant JSON structure 
 of the response, `data` is always an object. If you pass anything else, type casting will be done internally.
 There's no smart logic here, just ordinary `$data = (object)$data;`. The only exception are classes configured
 with "classes" mapping (see configuration details). In such case configured conversion method is called on
 the provided object and result is returned instead. Laravel's  `Model` and `Collection` classes are pre-configured
 but you can add additional classes just by creating entry in configuration `classes` mapping. 

 I recommend you always pass `$data` as an `array` or object with conversion mapping configured, otherwise
 passing other tipes to `ResponseBuilder` may end up with response JSON featuring oddities like array keys
 keys `0` or `scalar`.

 **IMPORTANT:** If you want to return own value of `$http_code` with the response data, ensure used
 value matches W3C meaning of the code. `ResponseBuilder` will throw `\InvalidArgumentException` if 
 you try to call `success()` (and related methods) with `$http_code` not being in range of 200-299. 
 The same will happen if you try to call `error()` (and family) with `$http_code` lower than 400.

 Other HTTP codes, like redirection (3xx) or (5xx) are not allowed and will throw `\InvalidArgumentException`.

 See [W3 specs page](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) for more details about
 available HTTP codes and its meaning.

#### Reporting Success ####

    success($data=null, $api_code=null, array $lang_args=[], $http_code=null, $encoding_options=null);
    successWithCode($api_code=null, array $lang_args=[], $http_code=null);
    successWithHttpCode($http_code);

 Usage restrictions:

 * `$http_code` must be in range from 200 to 299

#### Reporting Error ####

    error($api_code, $lang_args=[], $data=null, $http_code=HttpResponse::HTTP_BAD_REQUEST);
    errorWithData($api_code, $data, array $lang_args=[], $encoding_options=null);
    errorWithDataAndHttpCode($api_code, $data, $http_code, array $lang_args=[], $encoding_options=null);
    errorWithHttpCode($api_code, $http_code, $lang_args=[]);
    errorWithMessage($api_code, $error_message, $http_code=HttpResponse::HTTP_BAD_REQUEST);

 Usage restrictions:

 * `$api_code` must not be 0 (zero)
 * `$http_code` must not be lower than 400

## Data Conversion ##

 `ResponseBuilder` can save you some work by automatically converting certain objects
 prior returning response array. i.e. you can pass Eloquent's Model or Collection
 object directly and have it converted to array automatically.

 For example, passing `Model` object:

    $flight = App\Flight::where(...)->first();
    return ResponseBuilder::success($flight);

 will return:

    {
       "item": {
          "airline": "lot",
          "flight_number": "lo123",
          ...
       }
    }

 Or you have more data, the pass `Collection`:

    $flights = App\Flight::where(...)->get();
    return ResponseBuilder::success($flights);

 which would return array of objects as expected:

    {
       "items": [
          {
             "airline": "lot",
             "flight_number": "lo123",
             ...
          },{
             "airline": "american",
             "flight_number": "am456",
             ...
          }
       ]
    }

 The result is keyed `item` and `items`, depending on class name (therefore you will always get `items` 
 keys even if `Collection` holds one or even zero elements) is the given object of and the
 whole magic is done by calling method configured for given class.

 The whole functionality is configurable via `classes` mapping array (see config file for details).

 When you pass the array it will be walked recursively and the conversion will take place
 on all known elements as well:

    $data = [
       'flight' = App\Flight::where(...)->first(),
       'planes' = App\Plane::where(...)->get(),
    ];

 would produce the following response (contrary to the previous examples, source array keys are preserved):

    {
       "flight": {
          "airline": "lot",
          "flight_number": "lo123",
          ...
       },
       "planes": [
          {
             "make": "airbus",
             "registration": "F-GUGJ",
             ...
          },{
             "make": "boeing",
             "registration": "VT-ANG",
             ...
          }
       ]
    }

## Requirements ##

Minimum requirements:

  * PHP 5.5
  * Laravel 5.1.45

The following PHP extensions are optional but strongly recommended: 

   * iconv
   * mb_string

----

## Installation and Configuration ##

To install `ResponseBuilder` all you need to do is to open your shell/cmd and do:

    composer require marcin-orlowski/laravel-api-response-builder

If you want to change defaults then you should publish configuration file to 
your `config/` folder once package is installed:

    php artisan vendor:publish

and tweak this file according to your needs. If you are fine with defaults, this step
can safely be skipped (you can also remove published `config/response_builder.php` file).


#### Laravel 5.5+ setup ####

`ResponseBuilder` supports Laravel 5.5's auto-discovery feature, so if you are using such
version, you do not need to do much to make it work.

#### Laravel older than 5.5 ####

If you use Laravel 5.4 or older, then you need to manually register `ResponseBuilder` provider
for Laravel to know about it existence. Edit `app/config.php` and add the following line to your
`providers` array:

    MarcinOrlowski\ResponseBuilder\ResponseBuilderServiceProvider::class,


#### ApiCodes class ####

To keep your source readable and clear, it's strongly recommended to create separate class 
`ApiCode.php` (i.e. in `app/`) and keep all codes there as `const`. This way you protect 
yourself from using wrong code or save your time in case you will need to refactor code 
range in future. For example, your imaginary `app/ApiCode.php` can look like this:

    <?php

    namespace App;

    class ApiCode {
       const SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG = 250;
    }


#### ResponseBuilder Configuration ####

Package configuration can be found in `config/response_builder.php` file and 
each of its element is heavily documented in the file, so please take a moment
and read it.

Supported configuration keys (all keys **MUST** be present in config file):

 * `min_code` (int) lowest allowed code for assigned code range (inclusive)
 * `max_code` (int) highest allowed code for assigned code range (inclusive)
 * `map` (array) maps error codes to localization string keys.

Code to message mapping example:

    'map' => [
        ApiCode::SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG => 'api.something_went_wrong',
    ],

If given error code is not present in `map`, `ResponseBuilder` will provide fallback message automatically 
(default message is like "Error #xxx"). This means it's perfectly fine to have whole `map` array empty in
your config, however you **MUST** have `map` key present nonetheless:

    'map' => [],

Also, read [Overriding built-in messages](#overriding-built-in-messages) to see how to override built-in
messages.

**NOTE:** Config file may grow in future so if you are not using defaults, then on package upgrades
check CHANGES.md to see if there're new configuration options. If so, and you already have config
published, then you need to look into dist config file in `vendor/marcin-orlowski/laravel-api-response-builder/config/`
folder and grab new version of config file.

----

## Messages and Localization ##

`ResponseBuilder` is designed with localization in mind so default approach is you just set it up
once and most things should happen automatically, which also includes creating human readable error messages.
As described in `Configuration` section, once you get `map` configured, you most likely will not
be in need to manually refer error messages - `ResponseBuilder` will do that for you and you optionally
just need to pass array with placeholders' substitution (hence the order of arguments for `errorXXX()`
methods). `ResponseBuilder` utilised standard Laravel's `Lang` class to deal with messages, so all 
localization features are supported.

----

## Handling Exceptions API way ##

Properly designed REST API should never hit consumer with anything but JSON. While it looks like easy task, 
there's always chance for unexpected issue to occur. So we need to expect unexpected and be prepared when 
it hit the fan. This means not only things like uncaught exception but also Laravel's maintenance mode can 
pollute returned API responses which is unfortunately pretty common among badly written APIs. Do not be 
one of them, and take care of that in advance with couple of easy steps. 
With Laravel this can be achieved with custom Exception Handler and `ResponseBuilder` comes with ready-to-use
Handler as well. See [exceptions.md](exceptions.md) for easy setup information.

----

## Manipulating Response Object ##

If you need to return more fields in response object you can simply extend `ResponseBuilder` class
and override `buildResponse()` method:

    protected static function buildResponse($code, $message, $data = null);

For example, you want to get rid of `locale` field and add server time and timezone to returned
responses. First, create `MyResponseBuilder.php` file in `app/` folder (both location and class
name can be anything you wish, just remember to adjust the namespace too) and override
`buildResponse()` method which builds normalized response array for all the helper methods.
So the class content should be as follow:

    <?php

    namespace App;

    class MyResponseBuilder extends MarcinOrlowski\ResponseBuilder\ResponseBuilder
    {
       protected static function buildResponse($code, $message, $data = null)
       {
          // tell ResponseBuilder to do all the heavy lifting first
          $response = parent::buildResponse($code, $message, $data);

          // then do all the tweaks you need
          $date = new DateTime();
          $response['timestamp'] = $date->getTimestamp();
          $response['timezone'] = $date->getTimezone();

          unset($response['locale']);

          // finally, return what $response holds
          return $response;
       }
    }

and from now on use `MyResponseBuilder` class instead of `ResponseBuilder`. As all responses are
always produced with use of `buildResponse()` internally, your **all** responses will be affected
the same way. For example:

    MyResponseBuilder::success();

which should then return your desired JSON structure:

     {
        "success": true,
        "code": 0,
        "message": "OK",
        "timestamp": 1272509157,
        "timezone": "UTC",
        "data": null
     }

and 

    $data = [ 'foo'=>'bar ];
    return MyResponseBuilder::errorWithData(ApiCode::SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG, $data);

would produce:

    {
       "success": false,
       "code": 250,
       "message": "Error #250",
       "timestamp": 1272509157,
       "timezone": "UTC",
       "data": {
          "foo": "bar"
       }
    }

----

## Overriding built-in messages ##

At the moment `ResponseBuilder` provides few built-in messages (see [src/ErrorCode.php](src/ErrorCode.php)):
one is used for success code `0` and another provides fallback message for codes without custom mapping. If for 
any reason you want to override them, simply map these codes in your `map` config using codes from package
reserved range:

     MarcinOrlowski\ResponseBuilder\ApiCodeBase::OK => 'my_messages.ok',

and from now on, each `success()` will be returning your message instead of built-in one.

To override default error message used when given error code has no entry in `map`, add the following:

     MarcinOrlowski\ResponseBuilder\ApiCodeBase::NO_ERROR_MESSAGE => 'my_messages.default_error_message',

You can use `:api_code` placeholder in the message and it will be substituted actual error code value.
