# REST API Response Builder for Laravel #

> ![WARNING](img/warning.png) This library follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).
> See [compatibility docs](compatibility.md) for details about backward compatibility
> **before** doing major upgrade!

From release 9.4 onward, `ResponseBuilder` major version number is in sync with `Laravel`'s major
version number to show target framework version. If you use `Laravel 9` - you'd need to depend on
`ResponseBuilder v9.*`. Version `ResponseBuilder v10.*` would be then your dependency in (future)
`Laraver v10` based projects, and so on. Also, due to limited time and funds I am having to maintain
this project, only the most recent Laravel version will be officially supported. The same applies to
PHP version requirement. Starting from v9.5, `ResponseBuilder` requires exactly the same PHP
version `Laravel` do, even if technically still should work perfect on older versions too. That
should pose no real problem for you as `ResponseBuilder` has solid and stable code base and **you**
should be able to easily backport future new features to older versions rather easily.
