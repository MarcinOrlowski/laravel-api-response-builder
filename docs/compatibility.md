# Incompatibility notes #

Backward (in)compatibility notes. Pay attention if you are upgrading.

## v9 ##

* `[BREAKING]` Due to introduction of primitives support as direct payload, structure of `converter` config entry changed.
* `[BREAKING]` Due to introduction of primitives support as direct payload, the content of `data` object in the response may differ
  from what previous versions returned in case of passing primitives directly, mainly `array`s, i.e. `success(['a', 'b']);`, as
  other types were not allowed previously anyway.
* `[BREAKING]` Class mappings of `converter` are now moved to `classes` sub-array of `converter` config.
* `[BREAKING]` The `key` item for each converter confugured in `converter/map` is mandatory for each converter defined.
* `[BREAKING]` The `JsonSerializable` are no longer using hardcoded `val` key when converted, but proper `key` from its config.
* `[NEW]` The `primitives` config array added to `converter`. See [docs](config.md) for more information.
* `[Low]` For better error reporting and handling, `ResponseBuilder` throws own, more descriptive exceptions in majority of cases.
  See [src/Exceptions](../src/Exceptions).


## v8 ##

* `[BREAKING]` Due to introduction of exception handlers, `ExceptionHandler` configuration has been changed.
  See [configuration docs](config.md#exception_handler) for more information.
* `[Very Low]` Removed `ResponseBuilderLegacy` class from the package.


## v7 ##

* `[BREAKING]` As the library API migrated to Builder type of implementation, all the former API methods are now removed from
  `ResponseBuilder` class (with exception for `success()` and `error()` methods. While it is strongly recommended to switch
  to new, more flexible API, the old API can still be used with aid of `ResponseBuilderLegacy` class, which wraps old API and
  uses new API under the hood (see source code of `ResponseBuilderLegacy` for implementation details). To use legacy wrapper
  during transition period, simply add `use MarcinOrlowski\ResponseBuilder\ResponseBuilderLegacy as ResponseBuilder` and
  you should be all good. NOTE: `ResponseBuilderLegacy` class will be removed in v8.
* `[BREAKING]` The `ExceptionHandler` configuration array structure changed, but it only affects you,
  if you have custom configuration for `ExceptionHandlerHelper` (See [configuration docs](config.md) for more information).
  If you do not use it or do just use default configuration, then you are not affected.
* `[BREAKING]` Data converter config's `method` key is gone. Now you have to use `handler` and give name of class
  that implements `ConverterContract`.
* `[BREAKING]` CONFIG: `classes` key is renamed to `converter`.
* `[Low]` Data converter config's `key` config element is now gone. This change only affects those who use data converting
  feature **AND** pass objects directly (i.e. not as part of collection nor array).


## v6 ##

* Requires Laravel 6.0+ and PHP 7.2+
* `[BREAKING]` In previous versions built-in reserved codes were hardcoded and always in range of 1-63 which, in general
  contradicted the whole idea of having code ranges. Starting from v6, all your API codes are always within user assigned code range
  including built-in codes. This implies some breaking changes to the configuration of `ResponseBuilder` and some changes
  in the way built-in codes are handled. Because all built-in codes are now remapped to user defined code range, all built-in code
  constants like `OK` or `EX_HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, previously defined in `BaseApiCodes` class are gone. If you for any reason
  need to get the value of built in code, use  what's the value You can still have If you need to get the value of
  built-in code you need to use replacement methods. These are named the same way as the constants, so if you want to get code
  of `ApiCodes::OK` you need to call `ApiCodes::OK()` (or directly, `BaseApiCodes::OK()`). See `BaseApiCodes` class for all
  available public functions. Additionally, first 20 codes (0 to 19 inclusive) of your code range is reserved for built-in codes,
  which means that if you define your code range to be `100`-`199` then you cannot use codes `100` to `119` for own purposes.
  The first code you can assign to own API code is `120`.
* `[Low]` Removed `exception_handler.use_exception_message_first` feature.
* `[Low]` Removed `RB::DEFAULT_API_CODE_OK` constant.
* `[Low]` Removed `getReservedMinCode()`, `getReservedMinCode()`, `getReservedMessageKey()` methods from `ApiCodesHelpers` trait.
* `[Low]` All `ResponseBuilder` internal code constants are removed. If you need to get the valid API code for internal codes,
  use `BaseApiCodes` class' methods: `OK()`, `NO_ERROR_MESSAGE()`, `EX_HTTP_NOT_FOUND()`, `EX_HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE()`,
  `EX_HTTP_EXCEPTION()`, `EX_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION()`, `EX_AUTHENTICATION_EXCEPTION()` and `EX_VALIDATION_EXCEPTION()` that would
  return valid API code in currently configured range.
* `[Low]` Removed `response_key_map` configuration option.
* `[Very Low] (v6.1)` Removed ability to define own names for response keys which reduces code complexity and simplifies the
  library. From now one you need to stick to default names now (`success`, `code`, `message`, `locale`, `data`).
* `[Very Low] (v6.2)` Data conversion logic changed slightly. Now it checks if we have configuration entry matching **exactly**
  the object's class name. If not, then we'd try to find if we have any configuration for its parent class.
  See [Data Conversion](conversion.md) for details.
* `[BREAKING] (v6.3)` This is backward incompatible change in signature of `RB::buildResponse()`, but it only affects
  you if you extend `ResponseBuilder` and provide own implementation to manipulate response object
  (see [Manipulating Response Object](response.md)). If you do not, then you are not affected.


## v5 ##

* No public release.


## v4 ##

* `ApiCodeBase` class is now `BaseApiCodes`
* ExceptionHandler's debug trace no longer depends on `APP_DEBUG` value and can be enabled independently


## v3 ##

* `success()` now accepts (optional) `api_code` too, therefore signature of this method as well as and argument
  order changed. This makes it **partially** incompatible with what have been in v2, however in majority of uses
  this change should pose no threat at all. If you were just calling `success()` or `success($data)` (which is
  99,9% of use cases) then you are all fine and no change is needed. But if you were setting own
`http_code` or `lang_args` when calling `success()` then you need to update your code.
* `:api_code` is now the code value placeholder in all the strings. `:error_code` is no longer supported
* `ErrorCodes` class is now `ApiCodeBase`
* ApiCodeBase's `getErrorCodeConstants()` is now `getApiCodeConstants()`
* ApiCodeBase's `getMapping()` is now `getCodeMessageKey()`
* ApiCodeBase's `getBaseMapping()` is now `getReservedCodeMessageKey()`
* Internal constants for `ExceptionHandlerHelper` supported exceptions are now prefixed with `EX_` (i.e. `HTTP_NOT_FOUND`
  is now `EX_HTTP_NOT_FOUND`)


### v2 ###

* First public release


### v1 ###

* Initial (internal) release
