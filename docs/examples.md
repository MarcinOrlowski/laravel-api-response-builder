# Examples #

 The following examples assume `ResponseBuilder` is properly installed and available to your Laravel application.
 See [Installation and Configuration](installation.md) for more details.

## Success ##

 To create response indicating operation success, simply conclude your Controller method with:

```php
return RB::success();
```

 which will produce and return the following JSON object:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "code": 0,
  "locale": "en",
  "message": "OK",
  "data": null
}
```

 If you would like to return some data in your response, which is pretty much always the case for success type of responses:), pass
 your payload as `success()`'s argument:

```php
$data = [ 'foo' => 'bar' ];
return RB::success($data);
```

 This which would produce:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "code": 0,
  "locale": "en",
  "message": "OK",
  "data": {
      "foo": "bar"
  }
}
```

 As you noticed, arrays with keys are mapped to JSON objects. But if your array has only numeric
 keys, it will be treated specially:

```php
$returned_array = [1,2,3];
return RB::success($returned_array);
```

 which would give:

```json
{
   ...
   "data": {
      "items": [1, 2, 3]
   }
}
```

 > ![WARNING](img/warning.png) Passing key array with mixed keys i.e. `['foo'=>'bar', 'no-explicit-key']` is currently not
 > supported (and, most likely, never will) and it will result in runtime exception thrown when encountered. This is because
 > `ResponseBuilder` is unable to figure out how it should convert that array. For such cases either drop the keys (i.e.
 > `RB::success(\array_values($data));`) or ensure all entries have non-numeric keys.

 As all the data in the response structure must strictly follow response structure and end up in form os valid JSON data.
 `ResponseBuilder` deals with all the primitives and most commonly used classes, using on-the-fly data conversion, with most
 commonly used covered by built-in configuration.

 Need to additionally return some models the response? Simply pass it as argument to `success()` and it will be automatically
 converted by `ResponseBuilder`:

```php
$flight = App\Flight::where(...)->get();
return RB::success($flight);
```

 and your client will get that data in `data` node of your response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "code": 0,
  "locale": "en",
  "message": "OK",
  "data": {
     "items": [
        {
          "airline": "lot",
          "flight_number": "lo123",
          ...
       },
       {
          "airline": "american",
          "flight_number": "am456",
          ...
       }
    ]
  }
}
```

 You can easily add own converters if none of built-in handles your data or fits your needs!
 See [Data Conversion](conversion.md) for more details.


## Errors ##

 Returning error responses is also simple, however in such case you are required to need to additionally pass at least your own
 error code to `error()` to tell the client what the error it is:

```php
return RB::error(<CODE>);
```

 To make your life easier (and your code [automatically testable](testing.md)) you should put all error codes you use
 in separate `ApiCodes` class, as its `public const`s, which would improve code readability and would prevent certain
 types of coding error from happening. Please see [Installation and Configuration](installation.md)
 for details.

 Example usage:

```php
return RB::error(ApiCode::SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG);
```

 Assuming `ApiCode::SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG` constants' value is `250`, you will get the following JSON response:

```json
{
   "success": false,
   "code": 250,
   "locale": "en",
   "message": "Error #250",
   "data": null
}
```

 Please see the value of `message` element above. `ResponseBuilder` tries to automatically obtain text error message associated
 with the error code used. If there's no message associated, it will fall back to default, generic error "Error #xxx", as shown
 above. Such association needs to be configured in `config/response_builder.php` file, using `map` array, so see
 [ResponseBuilder Configuration](config.md) for more information.

 As `ResponseBuilder` uses Laravel's `Lang` package for localisation, you can use the same features with your messages as you use
 across the whole application, including message placeholders:

```php
return RB::error(ApiCodeBase::SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG, ['login' => $login]);
```

 and if message assigned to `SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG` code uses `:login` placeholder, it will be correctly replaced with content of
 your `$login` variable.

 You can, however this is not recommended, override built-in error message mapping too as `ResponseBuilder` comes with
 `errorWithMessage()` method, which expects string message as argument. This means you can just pass any string you want and
 it will be returned as `message` element in JSON response regardless the `code` value. Please note this method is pretty
 low-level and string is used as is without any further processing. If you want to use `Lang`'s placeholders here, you need
 to handle them yourself by calling `Lang::get()` manually first and pass the result:

```php
$msg = Lang::get('message.something_wrong', ['login' => $login]);
return RB::errorWithMessage(ApiCodeBase::SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG, $msg);
```
